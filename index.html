						<div class="content">
							<p>Situated at 1100 m, Pachmarhi, popularly known as 'Satpura ki Rani' (Queen of Satpura), sits beautifully, embellished by nature and history, amidst the Satpura range. Legend says the Pandava brothers visited Pachmarhi during their exile.

This beautiful region in the hills, was discovered by Captain James Forsyth in 1857. This most popular hill station of Madhya Pradesh is a treasure with ancient caves of the Buddhist era residing in harmony with serene waterfalls.

Pachmarhi is sure to make you feel calm, the way you felt when you put your bare feet on the garden grass for the first time, as a child.</p>
